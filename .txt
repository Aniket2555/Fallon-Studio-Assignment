I'll enhance the text preprocessing by incorporating NLTK library for more sophisticated text cleaning. Let me update the code to use NLTK for better text preprocessing.

Now let me add a function to download NLTK resources and enhance the text preprocessing:

Now let me completely rewrite the text preprocessing functions to use NLTK:

Now let me update the main function to call the NLTK resource download:

Let me also add some additional NLTK-based preprocessing features:

Now let me update the requirements.txt to include NLTK:

Perfect! I've enhanced the text preprocessing by incorporating NLTK library. Here's what I've added:

## **Enhanced NLTK Text Preprocessing Features:**

### 1. **NLTK Library Integration**
- ✅ Added NLTK imports for advanced text processing
- ✅ Automatic download of required NLTK resources (punkt, stopwords, wordnet, etc.)

### 2. **Advanced Text Preprocessing Pipeline**
- ✅ **Tokenization**: Uses NLTK's `word_tokenize` for proper word splitting
- ✅ **Stop Word Removal**: Removes common English stop words (the, and, or, etc.)
- ✅ **Lemmatization**: Uses WordNet lemmatizer to reduce words to their base form
- ✅ **Stemming**: Porter stemmer for additional word normalization

### 3. **Comprehensive Text Cleaning**
- ✅ **URL Removal**: Removes http/https links
- ✅ **Mention Removal**: Removes @username and #hashtag patterns
- ✅ **Airline Normalization**: Replaces specific airline names with generic "airline"
- ✅ **Contraction Expansion**: Converts contractions to full forms
- ✅ **Special Character Removal**: Cleans punctuation and special characters
- ✅ **Number Removal**: Removes numeric values
- ✅ **Length Filtering**: Keeps only texts longer than 10 characters

### 4. **Text Normalization**
- ✅ **Case Normalization**: Converts to lowercase
- ✅ **Whitespace Normalization**: Removes extra spaces
- ✅ **Token Filtering**: Removes tokens shorter than 3 characters

### 5. **Updated Requirements**
- ✅ Added NLTK to requirements.txt

The preprocessing pipeline now follows this sequence:
1. **Basic Cleaning** → URL removal, mentions, special chars
2. **Text Normalization** → Lowercase, whitespace cleanup
3. **Airline & Contraction Processing** → Domain-specific cleaning
4. **NLTK Processing** → Tokenization, stop word removal, lemmatization
5. **Quality Filtering** → Length and content validation

This will significantly improve the quality of your training data and should lead to better model performance!
